"""
Concrete field implementations.

This package contains all the concrete field implementations, organized by type:
- force_fields: Position/orientation-based fields (attractors, repulsors, alignment)
- velocity_fields: Velocity-dependent fields (viscosity, damping)

These implementations are not meant to be imported directly by users.
Use the factory interface in the parent module instead.

"""
Core mathematical and foundational components for robotics control.

This module provides fundamental building blocks used throughout the library:
- Coordinate frames and spatial transformations
- Mathematical utilities and helper functions  
- Timing utilities for control loops

These components form the mathematical foundation for higher-level control algorithms.
